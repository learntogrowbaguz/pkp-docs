# Web of Science (Clarivate)

Web of Science (WoS) is a multidisciplinary collection of citation indexes covering life sciences, biomedical sciences, engineering, social sciences, arts and humanities. WoS contains both citations and full text content. The WoS Core Collection includes:

* Science Citation Index
* Social Sciences Citation Index
* Arts & Humanities Citation Index
* Conference Proceedings Citation Index
* Book Citation Index
* Emerging Sources Citation Index
* Index Chemicus
* Current Chemical Reactions

Content in WoS is included in citation tracking, citation counts, and author h-index calculations; 
“Hot” and “Highly Cited” articles (top performing by citation comparison); and Journal Impact Factors and Journal Performance Quartiles.

## Selection Criteria

WoS measures both quality and impact in their selection. Journals that pass the quality criteria are accepted into Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI); those that also pass the impact criteria are included in additional databases as appropriate for the subject area. Journals that have been accepted to ESCI do not need to reapply for the additional databases; WoS automatically tracks and evaluates these publications and moves them to an appropriate database once the impact criteria is fulfilled.
