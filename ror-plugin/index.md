# ROR Plugin Guide

- [English](en/)

The Research Organization Registry (ROR) plugin allows both Open Journal Systems (OJS) and Open Preprint Systems (OPS) to offer a standardized list of organization names that researchers can choose from when entering information about their affiliation, thus ensuring that organization names are clean and consistent. This guide explains what ROR IDs are and how to enable and configure the ROR plugin. The ROR plugin is not available for or supported in Open Monograph Press (OMP).
