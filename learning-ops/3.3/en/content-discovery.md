# Content Discovery

OPS supports a number of ways to make the content on your Server discoverable to your readers. Most of which are built in functionality.

## Home Page

### Search by Category

If categories have been created, users will be able to search by these from your Servers homepage.

If subcategories have been created, users will be able to search these by clicking on the parent category.

### Advanced Search

The advanced search provides you with a few more filters to find content. This includes having a specific date range or by author name.
