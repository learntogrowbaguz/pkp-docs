# Pragma Theme

Pragma is a minimalist OJS theme inspired by early periodicalsâ€™ tables of contents featuring a bold use of a monochromatic colour palette.

[This OJS site](https://demo.publicknowledgeproject.org/ojs3/demo/index.php/pragma) demonstrates the Pragma theme.

Installation and configuration instructions are available in the theme's [style guide](https://github.com/pkp/pragma/blob/main/README.md).
