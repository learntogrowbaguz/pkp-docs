# Authoring

This chapter describes registering with a journal, making a submission, responding to peer review, and proofreading the publication-ready version of the manuscript in OJS as an author. 

If you are submitting to a journal using the OJS platform and are unfamiliar with the platform, you can refer to this chapter to learn how to proceed with your manuscript at any stage.

## Registering with the Journal {#register}

To make a submission to an OJS journal, you will first need to register a user account with a journal and log in \(see [Registering with a Journal](./user-accounts#registering-with-a-journal)\). After that, when you login, you will be taken to your Dashboard.

![Submissions queue in author dashboard](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-au-dashboard-empty.png)

It is currently empty as you have made no submissions.

<hr />

## Making a Submission {#submit}

Start a new submission by clicking the **New Submission** button on the right side of the screen. You will be taken to the submission wizard where you can upload and describe your submission.

![Author submission queue with new submission button](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-au-dashboard-empty.png)

### Preliminary Information

First, you will provide preliminary information about your submission

![Article submission start screen](./assets/learning-ojs3.4-au-wizard-1.png)

If the journal allows submissions in multiple languages, you will first need to select the appropriate language for your submission. (For Journal Managers: Additional Submission languages can be enabled in Website Settings -> Setup -> Language.)

Provide a title for your submission, then select the appropriate section for your submission \(e.g., article, review, etc.\)..

Review the submission checklist and ensure that your submission meets the journal’s requirements. 

Lastly, review the privacy statement and agree to the journal’s data collection policy in order to begin your submission. Once you click the Start Submission button, you will be able to save your incomplete submission for later and return to it from your dashboard at any time.

### Step 1: Details

In step one, you will provide some basic information about your submission, including the abstract, and optionally, keywords and a list of references.

As of OJS 3.4, limited HTML tags are supported for the formatting of manuscript titles and subtitles. Supported tags include ``<b>`` (bold), ``<i>`` (italics), ``<u>`` (underline), ``<sup>`` (superscript), and ``<sub>`` (subscript). These formatting options are also now available in the rich text editor when entering titles and subtitles.

To enter keywords, type the keyword or keyphrase and hit the Enter key. The word or phrase will be formatted as a keyword. There is no need to separate by commas or other punctuation.

If you have translated titles, abstracts or keywords to include, you can open additional fields for other languages by clicking the language in the upper right corner.

### Step 2: Upload Files

In **Step 2**, a window will open allowing you to upload your submission file(s).

![File upload screen](./assets/learning-ojs-3.3-author-submission-step2.png)

You can upload multiple files at once, as well as drag-and-drop files.

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true">
    <source src="./assets/submission3.3-files.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  <figcaption>How to drag and drop multiple files.</figcaption>
</figure>

Once you've uploaded all your files you will be asked to indicate the file type for each one. and metadata such as a description or license can be entered during the workflow.

Once you have finished uploading and indicating a type for all of your submission files, click the **Continue** button to move to the next step, adding contributor information.

### Step 3: Contributors

In this step, you will be asked to add more information about contributors (i.e. authors and translators) involved in the submission. By default, your details will already be added as the primary contributor.

![The list of contributors with different roles in the submission wizard](./assets/learning-ojs3.4-au-contrib-1.png)

You can add additional contributors (e.g., co-authors), by clicking the **Add Contributors** link. This will open a new window with fields to enter their information. It is important to note that all contributors will receive an email confirmation of the submission. Note that the instructions state false email addresses should not be used for contributors if there is no valid contact for the contributor. It is recommended that you inform editors about any contributors without valid email addresses in the next step of the process as a note to the editor.

![Add contributors](./assets/learning-ojs-3-author-submission-step3-2.png)

Hit **Save**, and the new contributor will be added to the list.

As of OJS 3.4, you are also able to alter the order of the list of contributors from the Order button. Click Order and press the up and down arrows beside a contributor to move them in the list. Click the Save Order button when you are done.

You can then preview the order in various forms, by using the “Preview Option” with options displayed for Abbreviated, Publication Lists, and Full order. 

![Preview of contributor list formatting](./assets/learning-ojs3.4-au-contrib-2.png)

Once all contributors have been added and ordered to suit your preferences,  click **Continue** to proceed.

### Step 4: Data Availability

Next, you’ll be asked to fill in optional fields to provide any information about the availability of your datasets (used when research data is shared in open data repositories) and comments to the editor. 

Enter any information about your data’s availability or comments to the editor and click **Continue** to proceed.


### Step 5: Review Your Submission

Finally, you’ll be given a chance to review all of the information you’ve entered for your submission. If there are any required fields not filled out, you will be warned on this screen and given the opportunity to make corrections.

After reviewing the details of your submission, you will be asked to read and agree to the copyright terms for submissions to the journal. 

Click the checkbox to agree and click the **Submit** button.

A box will pop up asking you to confirm you are finished. Click **Submit**.

![Confirm submission screen](./assets/learning-ojs-3-author-submission-step4-1.png


### Complete Your Submission

![Next steps submission screen](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-au-dashboard-new-5.png)

Your submission is now complete! The editor has been notified of your submission. At this point, you can follow the links to:

* Review this submission
* Create a new submission
* Return to your dashboard

### Accessing and Tracking Your Submission

The submission will now be listed on your dashboard for future access, where you can track its progress.

![Submission in author dashboard](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-au-dashboard-new-sub.png)

Once you complete a submission, you cannot make changes to it. If you wish to replace the file you submitted or make other changes to the submission, you will need to contact the editor through the Pre-Review Discussions tool accessible by clicking the “View” button next to the submission on your dashboard.

Immediately after submission, your submission will remain in the Submission stage until an editor accepts it for review, where it will move into the Review stage. If accepted for publication after review, it will later move into the Copyediting and Production stages before being published.

## Editing Submission Information {#edit}

Depending on the settings of the journal and its policies, you may be able to edit the information about your manuscript such as the title, contributors, keywords, etc. (referred to as “metadata” in the software) at different stages of the editorial workflow. Changes might include updated abstracts, correcting spelling errors, or adding additional contributors.

To make edits to your submitted manuscript, click on the Publication tab of your submission.

> If the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page is grey and inactive, this means you will have to request permission from the Editor to make changes to your submission or ask them to make the changes for you. {:.notice}

![Submission publication tab](./assets/learning-ojs3.2-auth-dashboard-publication.png)

Make changes to any of the information about your submission by clicking the related tab in the sidebar. If you have editing permissions, you will be able to make changes to the following sections on the Publication tab: Title & Abstract, Contributors, and Metadata.

![Publication menu items](./assets/learning-ojs3.2-auth-dashboard-publication2-language.png)

If multiple languages are enabled for the journal, you will be able to edit metadata in those languages by clicking on the relevant language tab in the top right. Click ‘Save’ once you’re done making your changes.

To learn more about creating quality metadata for your submissions, see [the Better Practices in Journal Metadata guide](/metadata-practices/en/).
