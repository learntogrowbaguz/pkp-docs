{:.notice}

OJS, OMP and OPS version 3.4 were released on June 9, 2023. This release notebook provides technical guidance on changes that will impact software developers, plugin and theme authors, and anyone who works with the application codebase.

## Hosting and Deployment

The following changes may effect anyone who hosts or deploys one of the applications, as well as those who develop plugins or themes for the applications.

### PHP 8.0+

The minimum required version of PHP is 8.0 or above, following PHP's [version support schedule](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php).

### Locales

The country code has been dropped from many locale keys. For example, `en_US` is now `en`. You may need to update the `locale` setting in the `[i18n]` section of `config.inc.php`. Supported locales can be found in the `locale` directory.

### Database Drivers

`mysqli` and `postgres9` are the only valid values for the `driver` setting in the `[database]` section of `config.inc.php`.

### Client Charset

The `client_charset` setting has been removed from `config.inc.php`. Only the UTF-8 charset is supported.

### Email

`PHPMailer` was replaced with [Laravel's Mailer](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/mail). Add the preferred method for sending emails, such as `sendmail` or `smtp`, to the `[email]` section of your `config.inc.php`:

```
; Default method to send emails
; Available options: sendmail, smtp, log, phpmailer
default = sendmail
```

Servers that use `sendmail` may need to add the path to the sendmail binary:

```
; Path to the sendmail, -bs argument is for using SMTP protocol
sendmail_path = "/usr/sbin/sendmail -bs"
```

It is now possible to send mail through third-party service providers like Mailgun. For sandbox environments, you can redirect mail to log files. Read [Utilities > Email](/dev/documentation/en/utilities-email) to learn more.

### Jobs and Queues

Jobs and queues are now used to manage long-running tasks. By default, these jobs will be processed during normal web requests, which may impact your site's performance. We recommend setting up a [worker daemon](/admin-guide/en/deploy#job-runner) to process jobs.

### Timezones

A new `time_zone` setting has been added to the `[general]` section of `config.inc.php`. See `config.TEMPLATE.inc.php` for supported timezones.

### Date/Time Formats

Valid date and time formats in `config.inc.php` must now be specified in [PHP DateTime formatting](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php). Recommended defaults can be found in the `config.TEMPLATE.inc.php` file.

```
date_format_short = "Y-m-d"
date_format_long = "F j, Y"
datetime_format_short = "Y-m-d h:i A"
datetime_format_long = "F j, Y - h:i A"
time_format = "h:i A"
```

The old formats are deprecated and support may be removed in a future version.

### Remove Unvalidated Accounts

A new `user_validation_period` setting has been added to the `[general]` section of `config.inc.php`. Use this setting to automatically delete accounts from users who never validated their account. See `config.TEMPLATE.inc.php` for a recommended default.

## Integrations

The following changes effect anyone who creates a plugin or theme for one of the applications, or wishes to integrate with the application through the REST API.

### Namespaces and Constants

Namespaces are now used in all PHP code in the software and many global constants have been replaced with class constants. This is a major change to our codebase that will require changes in most plugins or themes.

We strongly encourage you to use a code editor that supports autocomplete to help you import classes, discover methods and constants, and identify syntax errors. Type hinting is used throughout more of the codebase now in order to make it easier to understand and write code for our applications.

The `import()` statements and global constants like this are no longer used:

```php
import('classes.submission.Submission');
import('lib.pkp.classes.author.PKPAuthor');

$submission = new Submission();
$author = new PKPAuthor();

$submission->setData('status', STATUS_PUBLISHED);
```

Replace this code with `use` statements and class constants:

```php
use APP\submission\Submission;
use PKP\author\Author;

$submission = new Submission();
$author = new PKPAuthor();

$submission->setData('status', Submission::STATUS_PUBLISHED);
```

Plugin and theme developers who want to use namespaces in their own code should read the [instructions on how to adapt plugins](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/6091#issuecomment-796314189).

### HookRegistry Renamed

The `HookRegistry` class has been deprecated. Prepare for it to be removed in a future version by replacing this code:

```php
HookRegistry::register('...', function($hookName, $args) {});
HookRegistry::call('...', [$a, $b]);
```

With this code:

```php
use PKP\plugins\Hook;

Hook::add('...', function($hookName, $args) {});
Hook::call('...', [$a, $b]);
```

### Localization

Plugin and theme developers should rename the `locale` directories in their plugin according to the new locale codes mentioned above under [Locales](#locales).

We have replaced the `PKPLocale` and `APPLocale` classes with a new facade class. Read the [Utilities > Translation](/dev/documentation/en/utilities-translation) section of the developer docs to learn more about working with translations.

There is also a detailed [description of changes](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-docs/issues/953).

### Dates and Times

There are new [date and time formats](#datetime-formats) specified in the `config.inc.php`. Also, every journal, press or preprint server can configure different formats for every supported locale.

To show a date or time to a user, use one of the helper methods on the `Context` (journal, press or preprint server).

```php
$locale = Locale::getLocale();
$dateFormatShort = $context->getLocalizedDateFormatShort($locale);
$dateFormatLong = $context->getLocalizedDateFormatLong($locale);
$dateTimeFormatShort = $context->getLocalizedDateTimeFormatShort($locale);
$dateTimeFormatLong = $context->getLocalizedDateTimeFormatLong($locale);
$timeFormatShort = $context->getLocalizedTimeFormatShort($locale);
$timeFormatLong = $context->getLocalizedTimeFormatLong($locale);
```

Use the following to convert an old date/time format to the new format.

```php
use PKP\core\PKPString;

$newFormat = PKPString::convertStrftimeFormat($oldOrNewFormat);
```

Use the format with a timestamp to convert a date into the format desired by the journal, press or preprint.

```php
echo date($format, $timestamp);
```

### Repositories

Repositories were introduced to replace the entity `Service` class pattern that was introduced in 3.4. Repositories provided a better type-hinted interface to read and write data for many entities, such as submissions and authors. Learn more about [Repositories](/dev/documentation/en/architecture-repositories).

When a `Repository` class exists, plugin and theme developers should use the `Repo` facade instead of the `DAO` class to read and write data. Replace code like this:

```php
$submissionDao = DAORegistry::getDAO('SubmissionDAO');
$submission = $submissionDao->getById($id, $contextId);
$submission->setData('locale', 'en_US');
$submissionDao->updateObject($submission);
```

With code like this:

```php
use APP\facades\Repo;

$submission = Repo::submission()->get($id, $contextId);

Repo::submission()->edit(
    $submission,
    [
        'locale' => 'en',
    ]
);
```

Direct access to the `DAO` is discouraged. If you need to access the `DAO`, it is available through the `Repository`.

```diff
- $submissionDao = DAORegistry::getDAO('SubmissionDAO');
+ use APP\facades\Repo;
+
+ $submissionDao = Repo::submission()->dao;
```

Many of the service classes have been replaced by a repository. These often have the same or similar methods, but the function signatures may have changed. For example, the `add()`, `edit()`, and `delete()` methods no longer return the object that was added.

```diff
- $submission = Services::get('submission')->add($submission, $request);
+ use APP\facades\Repo;
+
+ $submissionId = Repo::submission()->add($submission);
+ $submission = Repo::submission()->get($submissionId);
+
- $submission = Services::get('submission')->edit($submission, $params, $request);
+ Repo::submission()->edit($submission, $params);
+ $submission = Repo::submission()->get($submission->getId());
```

The following service classes have been replaced by a repository.

```diff
- Services::get('announcement');
+ Repo::announcement()
- Services::get('author');
+ Repo::author();
- Services::get('submission');
+ Repo::submission();
- Services::get('publication');
+ Repo::publication();
- Services::get('issue');
+ Repo::publication();
- Services::get('galley');
+ Repo::galley();
- Services::get('user');
+ Repo::user();
```

This is a more disruptive change than we typically like to make. Modernizing our patterns in this way has significantly improved the experience of working with the codebase and detecting errors early. We recommend using an editor with autocomplete to benefit from this.

### Submission Progress

The `submissionProgress` property of a submission is now a `string`. This property used to be an `int` and was used to track the current step of the submission wizard for each submission. It now refers to the current step by one of the following: `start`, `details`, `files`, `contributors`, `editors`, `review`.

### HTML Titles

The `title`, `fullTitle`, and `subtitle` properties of a `Publication` may now include the following inline HTML tags `<i>`, `<b>`, `<u>`, `<sup>`, and `<sub>`. To get the HTML version of the title, pass `html` to the second argument of several publication methods.

```php
$title = $publication->getLocalizedFullTitle(null, 'html');
$title = $publication->getLocalizedTitle(null, 'html');
$subtitle = $publication->getLocalizedSubTitle(null, 'html');
```


### Jobs

Laravel's Jobs have been adopted to implement a jobs queue for long-running tasks. Plugin developers who want to use this feature should read how to [create and dispatch jobs](/dev/documentation/en/utilities-jobs).

### Events

Laravel's Events have been adopted to implement the observer pattern. Learn more about how to use [events and listeners](/dev/documentation/en/utilities-events). Plugin developers can see an [example listener](/dev/plugin-guide/en/example-events).

### Statistics

The Usage Stats plugin has been removed and statistics are now part of the core application. It has been rewritten from the ground up to support COUNTER R5, protect user privacy when compiling geographic stats, and support institutional stats by IP range. Many stats are now available through the REST API in JSON or CSV format.

System administrators may want to read about how to [configure and download statistics](/admin-guide/en/statistics). Plugin developers and contributors may want to review the new documentation on [how statistics are logged and compiled](/dev/documentation/en/statistics).

### Editorial Decisions

Editorial decisions have been refactored. If you have a plugin or theme which records an editorial decision or modifies the UI for recording an editorial decision, read the documentation about [decisions](/dev/documentation/en/decisions).

### Submission Wizard

The submission wizard has been rebuilt to use the REST API and the [form components](/dev/documentation/en/frontend-forms). Plugins that modify the submission wizard should use one of the following methods:

- Use the form hooks to add or edit fields in an existing form. See [example](/dev/plugin-guide/en/examples-custom-field) in the Plugin Guide.
- Use the `TemplateManager::display`, `Template::SubmissionWizard::Section`, and `Template::SubmissionWizard::Section::Review` hooks to add new forms or other components to a step in the submission wizard. An example can be found in the [funding plugin](https://github.com/ajnyga/funding/blob/5a4aa68ed4c6312544271c9c7fdabe48589d943e/FundingPlugin.inc.php#L64-L66).

The `submissionProgress` property has been changed from an integer to a string. View the [REST API documentation](/dev/api/ojs/3.4.html) for the new specification.

### REST API

Several new endpoints were added to the REST API for working with statistics, editorial decisions, contributors and submissions. See what's changed in the [3.4 API Reference](/dev/api/ojs/3.4.html).

### UI Library

New components were added to the UI Library, such as [Dialog](/dev/ui-library/dev/#/utilities/Dialog), [Composer](/dev/ui-library/dev/#/component/Composer), [FileAttacher](/dev/ui-library/dev/#/component/FileAttacher), [Steps](/dev/ui-library/dev/#/component/Steps), and more. View everything in the [UI Library](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/ui-library/dev).

### Hooks Removed

The following hooks were removed. In most cases, these hooks were removed because code was refactored in a way that made the hooks obsolete.

#### Mail::send

The `Mail::send` hook was removed as part of a major update to how emails are sent. To intervene when an email is sent, add a [listener](/dev/plugin-guide/en/example-events) to the `MessageSendingFromContext` and `MessageSendingFromSite` events. Learn more about the [new email system](/dev/documentation/en/utilities-email).

#### EditorAction::*

The `EditorAction::modifyDecisionOptions` hook was removed as part of a major refactor of [Decisions](/dev/documentation/en/decisions). Use the following to change the decision options available to an editor.

```php
use PKP\plugins\Hook;

Hook::add('Workflow::Decisions', function(string $hookName, array $args) {
    $decisionTypes = $args[0];
    $stageId = $args[1]; // eg - WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_*

    // ...
});
```

The `EditorAction::recordDecision` hook was removed as part of a major refactor of [Decisions](/dev/documentation/en/decisions). Add a [listener](/dev/plugin-guide/en/example-events) to the `DecisionAdded` event to perform some action when a decision is recorded.

#### *::getProperties

Several hooks which let you append data to API results have been removed. Replace these by [extending the entity's map](/dev/plugin-guide/en/examples-extend-map).

```diff
- Announcement::getProperties
- Author::getProperties::values
- EmailTemplate::getProperties
- Galley::getProperties::values
- Issue::getProperties::fullProperties
- Issue::getProperties::summaryProperties
- Issue::getProperties::values
- Publication::getProperties
- Section::getProperties::fullProperties
- Section::getProperties::summaryProperties
- Section::getProperties::values
- Submission::getProperties::values
- SubmissionFile::getProperties
- User::getProperties::fullProperties
- User::getProperties::reviewerSummaryProperties
- User::getProperties::summaryProperties
- User::getProperties::values
```

#### *::getMany

Several hooks which let you customize the database queries for entities have been removed. They have been replaced with the `Collector` classes. Use the `*::Collector` hook to modify the query. For example, code which registered functions on `Author::getMany::queryBuilder` and `Author::getMany::queryObject` should be adapted to the hook `Author::Collector`.

The following hooks were removed.

```diff
- Announcement::getMany::queryBuilder
- Announcement::getMany::queryObject
- Author::getMany::queryBuilder
- Author::getMany::queryObject
- EmailTemplate::getMany::queryBuilder
- EmailTemplate::getMany::queryObject::custom
- EmailTemplate::getMany::queryObject::default
- Galley::getMany::queryBuilder
- Issue::getMany::queryBuilder
- Publication::getMany::queryBuilder
- Publication::getMany::queryObject
- Stats::getOrderedObjects::queryBuilder
- Stats::getRecords::queryBuilder
- Stats::queryBuilder
- Stats::queryObject
- Submission::getMany::queryBuilder
- Submission::getMany::queryObject
- SubmissionFile::getMany::queryBuilder
- SubmissionFile::getMany::queryObject
- User::getMany::queryBuilder
- User::getMany::queryObject
- User::getReviewers::queryBuilder
```

#### *::_fromRow

Several hooks in the code that turns database results into a `DataObject` have been removed. Extend the properties of a `DataObject` by [extending its entity schema](/dev/plugin-guide/en/examples-custom-field).

```diff
- CategoryDAO::_fromRow
- IssueDAO::_fromRow
- IssueDAO::_returnIssueFromRow
- SectionDAO::_fromRow
- UserDAO::_returnUserFromRow
- UserDAO::_returnUserFromRowWithData
- UserDAO::_returnUserFromRowWithReviewerStats
- UserGroupDAO::_returnFromRow
```

The following hook was removed because the `ReviewerSubmissionDAO` object was removed.

```diff
- ReviewerSubmissionDAO::_fromRow
```

#### API::stats::*

Several hooks in the stats API have been removed as part of major changes to the stats system.

```diff
- API::stats::publication::abstract::params
- API::stats::publication::galley::params
- API::stats::publications::abstract::params
- API::stats::publications::galley::params
```

#### PKPLocale::*

The hook `PKPLocale::installLocale` was replaced with `Locale::installLocale`. The following hooks were removed.

```diff
- PKPLocale::installLocale
- PKPLocale::registerLocaleFile
- PKPLocale::registerLocaleFile::isValidLocaleFile
- PKPLocale::translate
```

#### Other Hooks Removed

Some hooks have been removed because the related code was removed.

```diff
- API::submissions::files::params
- ArticleGalleyDAO::getLocalizedGalleysByArticle
- PluginGridHandler::plugin
- PluginGridHandler::plugin
- SubmissionFile::assignedFileStages
- SubmissionHandler::saveSubmit
```

### Code Removed

As part of our efforts to modernize the code, several functions were removed, deprecated or replaced.

Get galley file ids from the new `Galley` object.

```diff
- ArticleGalley::getFileId();
- ArticleGalley::setFileId();
- PreprintGalley::getFileId();
- PreprintGalley::setFileId();
+ PKP\galley\Galley::getData('submissionFileId');
```

Don't use these methods to work with submission cover images. Get the cover image info from the `Publication` object instead.

```diff
- Submission::getCoverImage();
- Submission::getLocalizedCoverImage();
- Submission::getCoverImageAltText();
- Submission::getLocalizedCoverImageAltText();
- Submission::getLocalizedCoverImageUrl();
+ APP\publication\Publication::getLocalizedData('coverImage');
+ APP\publication\Publication::getLocalizedCoverImageUrl($contextId);
```

Several deprecated `Submission` methods have been removed. Use `Publication` methods instead.

```diff
- Submission::getAuthorString()
- Submission::getShortAuthorString()
- Submission::getPrimaryAuthor()
+ APP\publication\Publication::getAuthorString($userGroups)
+ APP\publication\Publication::getShortAuthorString()
+ APP\publication\Publication::getPrimaryAuthor()
```

For theme templates, this will require a change like this:

```diff
- {$article->getAuthorString()|escape}
+ {$article->getCurrentPublication()->getAuthorString($authorUserGroups)|escape}
```

Use `getSignature()` to get a user's contact signature:

```diff
- User::getContactSignature()
+ PKP\user\User::getSignature(Locale::getLocale())
```

Use `Repo::section()` to get section data:

```diff
- DAORegistry('UserGroupDAO')->...;
+ Repo::section()->...
```

Use `DB` facade instead of `Capsule` to access Laravel's QueryBuilder:

```diff
- use Illuminate\Database\Capsule\Manager as Capsule;
- Capsule::table('submissions')->...
+ use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
+ DB::table('submissions')->...
```

The `Mail` and `SubmissionMail` classes were removed in favor of `Mailables`. Read [Utilities > Email](/dev/documentation/en/utilities-email) to learn more.

Deprecated shims for Smarty2 functions within `PKPTemplateManager`, including `get_template_vars()` and `register_function()` were removed.  Legacy usage should move to Smarty3-compatible functions `PKPTemplateManager::getTemplateVars()` and `PKPTemplateManager::registerPlugin()`.
