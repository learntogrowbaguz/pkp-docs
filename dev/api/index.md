# REST API

OJS, OMP and OPS provide a REST API that can be used to interact with the application. Technical references are only available for OJS, but where the applications overlap they share the same API endpoints.

View the [OJS 3.4 Reference](./ojs/3.4) or read the usage guide for [older versions](./usage).
