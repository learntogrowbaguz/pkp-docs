# REST API Usage Guide

> This usage guide is for versions 3.3 and below.
{:.warning}

This document describes how to interact with the REST API provided by PKP applications. It is a technical document intended for software developers who wish to build applications to interact with OJS or OMP.

Skip to the [technical references](#references).

## About the API

The REST API will respond to HTTP requests with the requested data in JSON format. When receiving `POST` or `PUT` requests, it expects to receive a payload formatted in JSON.

## Access the API

Use the following to access the `/submissions` endpoint when an application is hosted at `https://example.com/`.

```
https://example.com/api/v1/submissions
```

A multi-journal OJS installation must access endpoints from each journal's URL.

```
https://example.com/journalpath/api/v1/submissions
```

Installations that do not use `mod_rewrite` must include `index.php`.

```
https://example.com/index.php/journalpath/api/v1/submissions
```

Installations which have set `disable_path_info` to `On` in the configuration file must use query parameters. **Use of this method is discouraged**.

```
https://example.com/index.php?journal=journalpath&endpoint=/api/v1/submission
```

Administrators can access _some_ endpoints, such as `/contexts`, at a site-wide endpoint that spans all journals.

```
https://example.com/index/api/v1/contexts
```

## Authentication

Only authenticated users can access the REST API endpoints. Authentication can be done with cookies or an API token.

### Cookies

Cookie-based authentication can be used when you are making a request from the same domain name as the application. When a request is made from the user's browser, the browser will send the cookies to the server.

A CSRF token must be sent with every `POST`, `PUT` or `DELETE` request when using cookie-based authentication. Read more about the [CSRF Token](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/ui-library/dev/#/pages/csrf).

### API Token

Your API token can be found by going to **User Profile > API Key** in the application. Add a query parameter, `apiToken`, to any request to the API.

```
https://example.com/api/v1/submissions?apiToken=eyJ0e...6vJU
```

> The `apiToken` will not validate if the `api_secret_key` setting has not been set in the application's `config.inc.php` file.
{:.tip}

## Query Parameters

The base endpoint for an entity will return a list of those entities. Typically, you can use query parameters in the request to filter, sort and paginate the requests.

### Filtering

The following will return only submissions that have been submitted to sections with an ID of `1` or `2`.

```
https://example.com/api/v1/submissions?sectionIds[]=1&sectionIds[]=2
```

When a query parameter is accepted as an array, it will often accept the parameter as a comma-separated string.

```
https://example.com/api/v1/submissions?sectionIds=1,2
```

### Sorting

The following will return submissions in alphabetical order.

```
https://example.com/api/v1/submissions?orderBy=title&orderDirection=ASC
```

### Pagination

The following will return the second "page" of results, if each page contained 30 results.

```
https://example.com/api/v1/submissions?count=30offset=30
```

Consult the [API Reference](#references) for a full list of supported query parameters.

## Multiple Languages

All PKP applications are multilingual. Multilingual fields will be provided as a JSON object with keys specifying the locale codes. The following response shows the `title` property of a publication in English and Canadian French.

```
{
	"title": {
		"en_US": "Young people from an immigrant background and their choice of post-secondary orientation in Montreal",
		"fr_CA": "Jeunes issus de l’immigration et choix d’orientation au postsecondaire à Montréal"
	},
	...
}
```

This is the same even when an installation only uses a single language.

```
{
	"title": {
		"fr_CA": "Jeunes issus de l’immigration et choix d’orientation au postsecondaire à Montréal"
	},
	...
}
```

When sending `POST` or `PUT` requests, the REST API will expect the data it receives to be passed in the same format.

## API Links

Some responses will include a `_href` property. The value of this property will be a URL to the full version of this object in the REST API.

```
{
	"_href": "http://example.com/api/v1/submissions/219"
	...
}
```

## Temporary Files

Files can be uploaded by sending a `POST` request to the `/temporaryFiles` endpoint. It will return a file ID which can be used in subsequent requests. Let's look at an example.

To upload a logo for a context (journal, press, or preprint server),  upload the image by sending a `POST` request to `/temporaryFiles`. A successful upload will generate the following response:

```
{
	id: 123
}
```

To save the logo to the context, send a `PUT` request to `/contexts/1`:

```
{
	pageHeaderLogoImage: {
		temporaryFileId: 123,
		altText: "Logo for the Journal of Public Knowledge"
	}
}
```

The file will be moved from the temporary directory to its public location, overwriting any existing logo.

Temporary files can only be managed by the **the user who uploaded the file**. If a user passes a `temporaryFileId` for a file they did not upload themselves, they will receive an authorization error.

## Unstable Endpoints

A few of the REST API endpoints are for internal use only and may be changed without notice. These endpoints are grouped in the **Backend** section of the references. Developers should expect that any integrations which make use of these endpoints could break from one version to the next.

## Updating the API documentation

Developers should update the API documentation whenever their code modifies a request or response. The API endpoints and query parameters are defined in an [OpenAPI v3 specification](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/blob/main/docs/dev/swagger-source.json)


Several `definitions` are left undefined in the specification file.

```
"definitions": {
	"Author": "author",
	...
}
```

These definitions are drawn from the [entity schemas](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/documentation/en/architecture-entities#schemas), and will be [merged with the source file](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-docs#generate-rest-api-references) when the API docs are built.
