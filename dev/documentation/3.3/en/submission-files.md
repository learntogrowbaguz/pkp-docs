# Submission Files

> Read and understand how [Files](./utilities-files) are handled before continuing.
{:.tip}

Submission files are used to track the progress of a file through the editorial workflow. For example, a file might be uploaded by the author during submission, promoted to the review stage by an editor, revised again by the author, and downloaded by a copyeditor.

Each `SubmissionFile` represents a file at one of these file stages. For example, when an editor promotes a file from the Submission stage to the Review stage, there are two `SubmissionFile` objects which refer to the same file.

| submission_file_id | file_id | file_stage                  |
| ------------------ | ------- | --------------------------- |
| 1                  | 82      | SUBMISSION_FILE_SUBMISSION  |
| 2                  | 82      | SUBMISSION_FILE_REVIEW_FILE |

Submission files can be revised. For example, the file in the Review stage may need to be anonymized before it can be sent for review. When the editor uploads a modified copy as a revision, the `file_id` is changed but a new `SubmissionFile` is not created.

| submission_file_id | file_id | file_stage                  |
| ------------------ | ------- | --------------------------- |
| 1                  | 82      | SUBMISSION_FILE_SUBMISSION  |
| 2                  | 83      | SUBMISSION_FILE_REVIEW_FILE |
| 2                  | 84      | SUBMISSION_FILE_REVIEW_FILE |

Editors and assistants can access all revisions of a file in the submission file's activity log.

## File Stages

All submission files are assigned to one file stage. File stages overlap with the submission workflow stages, but each workflow stage can have more than one file stage. For example, the Review workflow stage has one file stage for files to be sent to reviewers and another file stage for revisions uploaded by the author.

Most file stages correspond to a list of files in the submission workflow, such as the Review Files, Copyedited Files, or Production Ready Files. Other file stages are used to identify submission files that are attached to discussions, review assignments and galleys or publication formats.

| File Stage                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Files assigned to the review file or revision stages must be associated with a review round.

```php
$submissionFile->setData('fileStage', SUBMISSION_FILE_REVIEW_FILE);
$submissionFile->setData('assocType', ASSOC_TYPE_REVIEW_ROUND);
$submissionFile->setData('assocId', $reviewRoundId);
```

Files assigned to the `SUBMISSION_FILE_QUERY` file stage must be associated with a query note.

```php
$submissionFile->setData('fileStage', SUBMISSION_FILE_QUERY);
$submissionFile->setData('assocType', ASSOC_TYPE_NOTE);
$submissionFile->setData('assocId', $noteId);
```

## Submission File Service

Use the Submission File Service to add, edit and delete submission files. This helper class ensures that event logs are kept to track revisions, identify the uploader of a file, and update pending tasks.

Use the [File Service](./utilities-files) to create a file. Then assign the `fileId` to a `SubmissionFile`.

```php
$fileId = Services::get('file')->add($source, $destination);
$submissionFile = Services::get('submissionFile')->edit(
	$submissionFile,
	[
		'fileId' => $fileId,
		'uploaderUserId' => Application::get()->getRequest()->getUser()->getId(),
	]
);
```

Submission files can not be created without required properties.

```php
$submissionFile = DAORegistry::getDao('SubmissionFileDAO')->newDataObject();
$submissionFile->setAllData([
	'fileStage' => SUBMISSION_FILE_REVIEW_FILE,
	'fileId' => $fileId,
	'name' => [
		$primaryLocale => 'my-filename.txt',
	],
	'submissionId' => $submissionId,
	'uploaderUserId' => $userId,
]);
```

Validate the submission file before it is added or edited.

```php
$params = [
	'fileStage' => SUBMISSION_FILE_REVIEW_FILE,
	'fileId' => $fileId,
	'name' => [
		$primaryLocale => 'my-filename.txt',
	],
	'submissionId' => $submissionId,
	'uploaderUserId' => $userId,
];
$errors = Services::get('submissionFile')->validate(VALIDATE_ACTION_ADD, $params, $allowedLocales, $primaryLocale);
if (empty($errors)) {
	$submissionFile = DAORegistry::getDao('SubmissionFileDAO')->newDataObject();
	$submisssionFile->setAllData($params);
	$submissionFile = Services::get('submissionFile')->add($submissionFile, $request);
}
```

## Component Types

Submission files should be assigned a `genreId`. This matches one of the submission component types, such as Article Text, Data Set or Book Monograph.

```php
$submissionFile->setData('genreId', 1);
```

## File Access

Access to a submission file is granted based on the user's assignment to a submission. For example, an author should not be able to access files uploaded by reviewers. A copyeditor should only be able to access files in the copyediting stage.

Use the `Services::getAssignedFileStages()` method to determine what file stages can be accessed by a manager, subeditor, assistant or author.

```php
$stageAssignments = $this->getAuthorizedContextObject(ASSOC_TYPE_ACCESSIBLE_WORKFLOW_STAGES);
$assignedFileStages = Services::get('submissionFile')->getAssignedFileStages($stageAssignments, SUBMISSION_FILE_ACCESS_READ);
```

Use the `ReviewFilesDAO` to check if a reviewer can access a file.

```php
$reviewFilesDao = DAORegistry::getDAO('ReviewFilesDAO'); /* @var $reviewFilesDao ReviewFilesDAO */
$reviewerCanAccess = $reviewFilesDao->check($reviewAssignment->getId(), $submissionFile->getId());
```

Use the `QueryDAO` to check if a user can access a discussion file.

```php
if (
	$submissionFile->getData('fileStage') === SUBMISSION_FILE_QUERY &&
	$submissionFile->getData('assocType') === ASSOC_TYPE_NOTE
) {
	$queryDao = DAORegistry::getDAO('QueryDAO'); /* @var $queryDao QueryDAO */
	$noteDao = DAORegistry::getDAO('NoteDAO'); /* @var $noteDao NoteDAO */

	$user = Application::get()->getRequest()->getUser();
	$note = $noteDao->getById($submissionFile->getData('assocId'));

	if ($queryDao->getParticipantIds($note->getAssocId(), $user->getId())) {
		// User can access this submission file
	}
}
```

The following table describes when users are granted access to submission files.
