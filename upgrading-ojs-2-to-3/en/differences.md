## OJS 3 interface

There is a new interface for readers and editors, including a separate editorial interface that is visually distinct from the journal. Users with multiple roles are no longer required to select a role from their user homepage in order to access certain settings or administrative features; all the available options can be located in the new dashboard. This also allows for seamless switching between tasks associated with different roles. The new interface is illustrated below and explained in [What's New in OJS 3](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.2/en/introduction#whats-new-in-ojs-3).

## OJS 3 workflow

The editorial workflow in OJS 3 has been significantly revamped to be more flexible, which can be a large adjustment for your editors. OJS 3 consists of 4 editorial stages, any of which can be easily skipped:

1. Submission, where new submissions are dealt with (rejected, assigned to section editors, etc.)
2. Review, where peer review and author revisions take place
3. Copyediting, where the reviewed and revised files are sent for copyediting
4. Production, where the final, copyedited version is converted into publishable formats (PDF, HTML, etc.), proofread, and scheduled for publication.

Another new editorial feature is the introduction of an internal discussion feature for each editorial stage (Submission, Review, Copyediting, Production). These discussions work much like an online forum — a user creates a discussion topic, invites others to participate, and sends a message with any relevant attachments.

## Statistics

The type of statistics reports available and the way they are generated is another key change between versions. If your journal makes use of statistics reports, read the [Statistics guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/en/statistics), which explains the various types of reports available in each version and provides information on upgrading journals with legacy View Report data.

OJS 3 has new statistics features such as a visual dashboard of usage statistics for editors and journal managers and the ability to display an article’s usage statistics on the reader front end.

## Missing features

There are also some features from OJS 2 that are missing or still in development for OJS 3, including the following:

* Some plugins have not been ported to OJS 3, including Books for Review and Dataverse
* Email template management and user notification management is still being refined

It is important to take an inventory of your useful and frequently used plugins and features and their availability for the newer version of OJS before deciding to upgrade.

Lastly, updates and developments to OJS 3 are ongoing. If you are unsure about the status of a feature or plugin in OJS 3, search on the [PKP Community Forum](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/) and [PKP’s GitHub repository](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues) to see if it is actively being worked on. You can also request new features or tweaks to features that will improve OJS.
