# Requirements

In order to begin, you must be running ​**Open Journal Systems [Long-Term Support](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs/download/) version or newer**. If you are not sure what version of OJS you are running, see ​[How do I determine my PKP software’s version](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/t/how-do-i-determine-my-pkp-softwares-version/28534/2)?

Some steps in this guide require you to be able to access OJS in a Site Administrator role, others can be accomplished in the Journal Manager role, while others require access to configuration files as a System Administrator. 

You may have access to all or only one of these roles, so you may be able to accomplish the configuration yourself, or you may need to contact your hosting provider or technical lead to perform certain steps. 

Throughout the document, the required permissions are detailed.
