## Import/Export

![The list of import and export tools in OMP.](./assets/learning_omp-tools-import_export.png)

OMP provides a number of tools to import and export data into and out of your press. Please see [PKP’s Administrator’s Guide](/admin-guide/en/data-import-and-export) for information on how to use the Native XML Plugin and the Users XML Plugin. Please also note that the Quick Submit Plugin is not available for OMP.

To export using the ONIX 3.0 Monograph Export Plugin, you need to ensure that all of the fields are completed under Settings > Press > Publisher Identity.

The Tab Delimited Content Import Plugin can only be used with the command line.
